# datascience
This repository contains any data science work I do outside of work.

In the folder "FML" you will find "fml_forecast.ipynb"-- a Jupyter Notebook in which I do some web scraping, data cleaning, and forecasting work on Fantasy Movie League.

In the folder "Pokemon" you will find "Pokemon.ipynb"-- a Jupyter Notebook in which I do some data cleaning, exploration, and a simple classification model on a Pokemon dataset from  Kaggle.

Have fun searching through my side projects!
